# Coronovirus Lets Learn To Code

## Introduction

This is a running curriculum of the class

## Purpose

To have a single point of information

## Scope

Each day I will publish what we are going to learn.

As we get through it we will collect useful website, links and resources and I will update this document with them.

## Things you will need
