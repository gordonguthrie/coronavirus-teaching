# Coronovirus Lets Learn To Code

## Introduction

This is a running curriculum of the class

## Purpose

To have a single point of information

## Scope

Each day I will publish what we are going to learn.

As we get through it we will collect useful website, links and resources and I will update this document with them.

## Things you will need

* the Zoom video conference client installed (https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting)
* the Firefox web browser installed (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
* the Atom editor installed (https://atom.io/)

## Overall Plan

The plan is to try and get through:

* what is a web page made of?
  * html (HyperText Markup Language - a way of creating structured elements in a webpage)
    * the `<head>` section
    * the `<body>` section
    * basic elements
      * `<div>`
      * `<span>`
      * `<h1>` etc
      * simple form elements
         * no forms posting to a webserver - just input for javascript
  * css (Cascading Style Sheets - a way of making HTML look pretty)
      * basics of CSS
      * selectors/intro to specifity
      * ***advanced*** using a CSS framework (probably Semantic UI)
  * js (Javascript - a programming language)
      * functions
      * scope
        * (and its discontents)
      * the DOM (Domain Object Model - how we make things happen on a webpage in a browser)
        * (and its discontents)
        * ***advanced*** using a JS framework (deffo JQuery)
* building something - an in-page calculator
  * make it look like a calculator
  * collect inputs
  * write a programming language in Javascript to calculate the result
* ***if we have the time***
  * write some music using Sonic Pi (http://sonic-pi.net/)

## Day 1 - Lesson

* getting to know our tools
    * Atom editor
    * Firefox Web Developer Tools
* writing our first web webpage with HTML
    * basic elements
* make our first webpage less ugly with CSS
    * inline styles
* mucking our webpage about with JS
    * from the web console

## Day 1 - Lesson notes

### Day 1a - Small Web Page

Lets build the smallest web page that works. Traditionally in programming this is called `hello world` make your language display the words Hello word.

This is it in `html`

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    hello world
  </body>
</html>
```

This is actually not true - you can make smaller webpages.

### Day 1b - Proper Web Page

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Learning Coding In Lockdown</title>
    <meta name="description" content="My first webpage">
    <meta name="author" content="Gordon">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>Hello World</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Day 1c - Basic Tags

`html` pages are made from tags - which come in two sorts.

* enclosing tags
     * `<div>Hello world</div>`
         * there is an opening tag `<div>`
         * and then a matching closing tag `</div>`
         * these are just like `(` brackets `)` in written English
* self-closing tags
    * `<hr />`

Here are some basic enclosing tags:

* `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
* `<p>`
* `<div>`
* `<span>`

(Remember each opening tag `<div>` needs a closing tag after what it encloses `</div>`)

Here are some basic self-closing tags:

* `<br />`
* `<hr />`

### Day 1d - Nested Tags

Not all tags are stand alone. You need to nest tags inside tags sometimes.

An example is the bullet list and the numbered list

```HTML
<ul>
  <li>hello</li>
  <li>world</li>
</ul>
```

```HTML
<ol>
  <li>hello</li>
  <li>world</li>
</ol>
```

### Day 1e - Exercise 1

Write a short CV, header, paragraph or list, another header, another para or list.

Enclose all you content (words) in tags plz.

### Day 1f - Basic (Inline) Styling with CSS (Cascasding Style Sheet)

There are three ways you can do CSS:

* inline
     * write styles inside tags
* internal
     * write styles in the web page
* external
     * write styles in an external file and include that file into the webpage

  An inline style is just written into the tag:

  * `<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>`

Here are some basic styles:

* `style="background-color:DodgerBlue;`
* `style="color:MediumSeaGreen;`
* `style="border: 2px solid Tomato;"`
* `style="border: 2px solid red;"`
* `style="border-radius: 5px;"`
* `style="font-family:"Courier New", Lucida Console, monospace;"`
* `style="font-style:italic;"`

Styles can be combined in a tag:

* `<p style="background-color:gray;color:orange;">This is a paragraph.</p>`

This was the original way of styling elements in html. Its not really scalable, and it technically isn't **Cascading Style Sheets** its just styles.

`CSS` was invented to solve the problem of millions of elements each with dozens of styles - and each bullet point needing to have the same styles applied. Nobody uses `inline` styles (except when they do).

### Day 1g - Better (Internal) Styling with CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)

  Here is an internal style. The style rules are the same as in inline styling. The difference is that each style is now preceded with a `selector`.

```HTML
  <style>
  body {
    background-color: linen;
  }
  div {
    color: maroon;
    margin-left: 40px;
  }
  </style>
```

The format is:

* `selector`
* opening curly brackets `{`
* styles which are:
    *  `style type`
    * `:`
    * `style details`
* and closed  by a closing curly bracket `}`

It is enclosed in a style tag and (conventionally) is included in the `<head>` section.

```HTML
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>Learning Coding In Lockdown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My first webpage">
      <meta name="author" content="Gordon">
      <style>
      body {
        background-color: linen;
      }
      div {
        color: maroon;
        margin-left: 40px;
      }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div>Hello World</div>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <li>hello</li>
        <li>world</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>hello</li>
        <li>world</li>
      </ol>
    </body>
  </html>
```

These styles (with a single selector) apply to all tags of a type - all your paragraphs have the same font size. Lets fix that with some cascading style sheets.

### Day 1h - Cascading Styles

Lets get some text and some bullet points and then style part it.

```HTML
<h1>Gordon Guthrie</h1>
<p>I am a strong technologist with experience of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Erlang</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elixir</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LFE</p>
  </li>
</ul>
```

If we now add the style:

```HTML
<style>
  li p {
    font-style:italic;
  }
</style>
```

This selector `li p` says apply this style to all tags `<p>` inside a pair of `<li>` tags

The style has **cascaded**.

If we edit the style to say:

```HTML
<style>
  h1, li p {
    font-style:italic;
  }
</style>
```

This style now applies to the header as well as the bullet points.

The comma `,` is an operator - its technically a boolean `OR` so the selector `h1, li p` means *if the tag is* `<h1>` *OR the tag is a* `<p>` *inside an* `<li>`.

### Day 1i - Mucking about


If we open the `console` in `webtools` in Firefox we can now muck about with stuff.


## Day 1 - Homework

* investigate other webtools
    * Chrome
    * Safari
* investigate other `html` tags and HTML5
    * image
    * links
    * buttons
    * inputs
* investigate other CSS selector operators like
    * `>`
    * `+`
    * `~`
    * `[target]`
    * `[attribute=value]`
